1. The case_long_iso_time_style: was a go to label in the for loop,
this was - if (locale_format == long_time_format[i])
since we are removing the go to command in the for loop, this would have most
likely become redundant. Therefore it wasn't necessary to remove but
helpful from a readability standpoint.
2. If other commands in my companies code rely on the date being of the old
format, for eg: filling a form etc.
Non english speakers can probably understand dates in the numerical
format a lot more intuitively compared to dates/ they may not know
month acronyms.
3. Running the program on dev/null with the command
python randline.py -n 3 /dev/null
It gives an error IndexError: list index out of range
Exception was thrown when the program tried to read the file
since the file was empty
4. When I try to run the implementation with python3 instead of python
it gives a syntax error
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                          ^
                          SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This could be because python3 has different syntax than python2
It seems to be that python3 does not support automatic tuple unpacking
(errno,strerror).
