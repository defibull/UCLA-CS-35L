1. wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz to grab the file
   and store it in the home directory.
2. unzip tar file: tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   mkdir coreutilsInstall : make a temporary directory
   cd coreutils-7.6 : to see the directions as to how to configure
   The directions say : `cd' to the directory containing the package's source
   code and type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
   Since, some systems require unusual options, to check for my system;
        I ran ./configure --help
        To save it in the temporary directory - which was in the home
        directory:
        cd coreutils-7.6
        ./configure --prefix=/u/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutilsInstall
        make install : install the software
        cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
3.  I could then run the ls command to see whether or not the date came out in
  the wrong format
  Therefore: ./ls -l : gave me the date as 2015-10-17 07:10
  While the ls -l : gave me the date as Oct 17 07:10
4. We need to apply brady's patch, therefore :
   cd coreutils-7.6 ; cd src ; ls ; emacs ls.c
   alter the file according to the email by going to the appropriate locations
   and editing the file : I did the editing manually
5.   -------------------- The following are the commands that followed after I
ran make at the root
   with explanations ---------------------

make  all-recursive -- Run make recursively through the folders.
make[1]: Entering directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6'
Making all in lib
make[2]: Entering directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/lib'
make  all-recursive
make[3]: Entering directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/lib'
make[4]: Entering directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/lib'
make[4]: Leaving directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/lib'
make[3]: Leaving directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/lib'
make[2]: Leaving directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/lib'
Making all in src
make[2]: Entering directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/src'
make  all-am
make[3]: Entering directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna/coreutils-7.6/src'
  CC     ls.o                   -
  CCLD   dir                    ---> These are the commands that are
  CCLD   vdir                   -    rebuilding files I just changed
  CCLD   ls                     -
        make[3]: Leaving directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna
        /coreutils-7.6/src'
make[2]: Leaving directory '/w/home.04/ma/ugrad/khanna
        /coreutils-7.6/src'
        Making all in doc
        -- unnecessary commands here so I deleted them from lab notebook
        Making all in man
        -- unnecessary
              Making all in tests
              -- unnecessary commands like entering and leaving the directory
6. I ran the ./ls -l command in src - since the modified version was in src and
it gave me an output
-rw-r--r-- 1 khanna maugrad   3787 Sep  1  2009 basename.c
for a file that is atleast an year old
-rw-r--r-- 1 khanna maugrad  63744 Oct 17 07:10 cat.o
for a file that has been recently modified
while ./ls -l in the bin still gave me the wrong output (as it was the previous
version).
